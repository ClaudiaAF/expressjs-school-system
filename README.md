## Welcome



This is my ExpressJS Term 3 application, which makes use of an API created using Express JS and then displayed in React JS.

## Running the Project



* After cloning / downloading the Repo, run `<npm install>` in the terminal to ensure all the dependancies are loaded correctly

* Navigate to `/frontend` and run `<npm start>`

* Open a second terminal and navigate to `server` and run `<nodemon>` simultaneously with the frontend.

* Run `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the project.

## Backend - Get API data from server


Navigate to `<server.js>` and run `<nodemon>`
